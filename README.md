## My process
- Use figma to check the size of elements (e.g. margin, padding, gap, etc)

### Built with
- vanilla css

### What I learned
- things like `min-width: min(calc(100vw - 100px), 280px);` work
- flexbox elements alignment by default is `stretch`.

### Continued development
### Useful resources
- [Helper site to generate css boilerplate for fonts](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts)
